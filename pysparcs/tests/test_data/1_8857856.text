The diagnostic and therapeutic plan for the patient?s observation stay is serial EKGs, troponins, stress in AM.    Risk stratification: reasons why the patient cannot be either discharged or admitted after initial urgent care evaluation include elderly with HTN, too high risk for DC .     The patient will be discharged to outpatient care if serial trop/EKG neg, stress neg.     The patient will be admitted for inpatient care if positive EKG or trop or positive stress test.
